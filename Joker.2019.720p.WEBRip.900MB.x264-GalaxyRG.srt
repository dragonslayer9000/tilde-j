<i>I'm Stan L.
Brooks, and here's what's happening.</i>

8
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,491
<i>It's day 18
of the garbage strike,</i>

9
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:27,327
<i>with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.</i>

10
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,561
<i>Even the nicest sections
of the city</i>

11
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,031
<i>are looking like slums.</i>

12

<i>Health Commissioner

<i>for the first time in decades.</i>

<i>There's no need

16
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,539
<i>or comes down
with typhoid fever.</i>

17
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:42,475
<i>It's already
a serious situation.</i>

18
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,909
<i>It's
something that affects</i>

19
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,378
<i>almost everyone
in the city,</i>

20

21
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,382
<i>You can't go
down no one avenue</i>

22
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,717
<i>without seeing nothing
but garbage and rats.</i>

23
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,119
<i>It's starting to
affect my business</i>

24
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,586
<i>when customers
can't get in here</i>

25
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:56,289
<i>because of
the garbage situation.</i>

26
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,058
<i>I'm not out
that long to smell it,</i>

27
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,925
<i>but I think to look at
it, it's terrible.</i>

28

<i>It don't
affect me except</i>

29

<i>for the very bad
smell here.</i>

30
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,531
<i>It's horrific.</i>

31
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,032
<i>It's a mess.</i>

32
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,699
<i>I've been in this country
for 50 years,</i>

33
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,002
<i>and I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

34
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,470
<i>What is this world
coming to?</i>

35
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,272
<i>Put 'em
in a room,</i>

36
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,939
<i>let 'em sit there and talk

Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

48
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,093
Nice outfit, pal.

49
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,561
If you're gonna be a
clown, at least you could be

50
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,230
a good one.
You know that, right?

51
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,763
- Hey! Hey!
- Grab it!

52
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,099
Go, go, go!

53
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,534
Hey!

54
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,069
He's coming!

55
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,204
Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.

56
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,073
- Look at him running.
- Let's go!

57
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,574
Stop them!

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,076
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!

59
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,347
Where's
your sign, clown?

60
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,747
Hey!

61
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,686
Go, clown!
Come on!

62
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:35,888
Stop them!

63
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:39,259
Go! Come on!

64
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,861
Stop them!

65
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:44,830
Come on, run!

66
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:48,234
Hey!

67
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,869
You fucking...

68
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,577
Oh, shit! Good hit.

69
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,312
Come on!
Beat his ass up.

70
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,447
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.

71
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,516
Harder! Harder!

72
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,850
Beat him up.
Take his stuff.

73
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,753
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

74
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,310
Ha!

75
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,859
Is it just me,

76
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:56,529
or is it getting
crazier out there?

77
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:03,436
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

78
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,238
People are upset.

79
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,474
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

80
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,841
These are tough times.

81
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,380
How about you?

82
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,151
Have you been keeping
up with your journal?

83
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,587
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,191
Great.

85
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,093
Did you bring it
with you?

86
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,998
Arthur.

87
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,034
Last time,
I asked you to bring your journal

88
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,537
with you
for these appointments.

89
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,072
Can I see it?

90
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,952
I've been using it as a journal,

91
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,224
but also
as a joke diary.

92
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,993
Funny thoughts
or observations.

93
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,330
I think
I told you

94
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,433
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

95
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,472
No, you didn't.

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,042
I think I did.

97
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:28,421
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

98
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,773
How does it feel to
have to come here?

99
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,042
Does it help to have
someone to talk to?

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,114
I think
I felt better

101
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,350
when I was locked
up in the hospital.

102
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,586
And have you
thought more about

103
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,790
why you were
locked up?

104
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,996
Who knows?

105
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,739
I was wondering if you
could ask the doctor

106
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,940
to increase
my medication.

107
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,217
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

108
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,153
Surely,
they must be doing something.

109
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,725
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

110
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,130
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

111
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,068
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

112
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,503
Just stop.

113
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,779
What?
You think that's funny?

114
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,723
I'm sorry. I have a...

115
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,707
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,707
Happy,
did you check the mail

117
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,110
before you came up?

118
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,844
Yeah, Mom.

119
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,413
Nothing.

120
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,951
<i>And finally, tonight,</i>

121
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,520
<i>just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse...</i>

122
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,988
<i>...authorities are saying</i>

123
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,125
<i>the city is under siege
by scores of rats.</i>

124
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,525
<i>And not just any rats,</i>

125
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,661
<i>but super rats,
who are hard to kill.</i>

126
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,929
He must not be
getting my letters.

127
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,098
Yeah.

128
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,266
It's Thomas Wayne,
Mom.

129
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,734
He's a busy man.

130
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,872
Please. I worked for
that family for years.

131
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,341
The least he could do
is write back.

132
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,979
Here. Don't get all worked up.
Eat.

133
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,347
You need to eat.

134
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,018
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.

135
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,421
<i>Both victims
were taken to Gotham General.</i>

136
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,889
<i>Sounds like</i>

137

<i>the city needs to
find the Pied Piper.</i>

138
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,492
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

139
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,496
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?

140
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,932
Well, everybody
on the news.

141
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,401
He's the only one who
could save the city.

142
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,936
He owes it to us.

143
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,340
Come sit. It's starting.

144
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,876

Thank you.

We got a great-looking

So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

161
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,666
- are in Gotham now, right?
- Yeah.

162
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:51,303
Well, today,
the mayor said he has a solution.

163
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,073
You ready for this?

164
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,440
Super cats.

165
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,279
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

166
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,981
I love you,
Murray!

167
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,085
I love you, too.

168
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,754
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

169
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,955
Who is that?

170
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,159
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

171
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,227
Stand up for me.

172
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,494
Go ahead.

173
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,568
What's your name?

174
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,703
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

175
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,572
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

176
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,374
Oh, okay. Well,
there's something special about you,

177
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,542
Arthur, I could tell.

178
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,676
Where are you from?

179
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,578
I live right here
in the city

180
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,513
with my mother.

181
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,882
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

182
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,717
There's nothing funny
about that.

183
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,820
I lived with my mother before I made it.
Just me and her.

184
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,789
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

185
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,058
and he never
came back.

186
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,392
Aww.

187
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,094
I know
what that's like, Murray.

188
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,863
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

189
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,932
I take good care
of my mother.

190
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,073
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

191
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,807
She does.

192
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,778
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

193
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,547
She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.

194
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,382
Aww.

195
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,686
Wow.

196
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,958
I like that. I like that a lot.
Come on down.

197
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,961
Come on.
For that, you gotta come down.

198
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,562
Come on! Come on.

199
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,738
Come on.

200
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,190
Okay, we got a big show tonight.
Stay tuned.

201
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,625
We'll be right back.

202
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,194
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

203
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,229
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

204
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,529
It made my day.

205
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,032
Thanks, Murray.

206
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,833
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

207
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,401
the audience,
all that stuff?

208
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,602
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

209
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,005
to have a kid
like you.

210
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,448
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

211
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,318
Another day
in chuckle town.

212
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,584
Yup.

213
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,090
You okay?

214
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,660
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

215
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,496
Fucking savages.

216
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,300
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

217
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,934
No.

218
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,869
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

219
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,771
All the crazy shit
out there.

220
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,807
They're animals.

221
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,646
You know what?

222
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,852
Here.

223
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,090
What is it?

224
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,224
Take it.

225
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,226
It's for you.

226
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,100
You gotta
protect yourself out there.

227
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,967
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

228
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,803
Randall,

229
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,874
I'm not supposed to
have a gun.

230
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,445
Don't sweat it, Art.

231
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,879
No one
has to know.

232
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,383
And you can pay me
back some other time.

233
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,816
You know
you're my boy.

234
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,254
Arthur,

235
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,423
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

236
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,359
Hey, Gary.
You know what I've always wondered?

237
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,659
No idea.

238
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,528
Do you people call it
miniature golf

239
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,864
or is it just golf
to you?

240
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,970
Punch him in the
dick, Gary.

241
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,523
Hello, Hoyt.

242
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,059
Gary said you wanted to see me.

243
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,262
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

244
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,562
Not quite.

245
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,664
Just been working
on my material.

246
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,733
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

247
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,469
Look,
I like you, Arthur.

248
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,869
You know,
a lot of the guys,

249
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,305
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

250
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,774
I don't even know
why I like you.

251
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,011
But I got
another complaint.

252
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,979
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

253
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,981
The guy said
you disappeared.

254
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,750
Never even
returned his sign.

255
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,520
Because I got jumped.

256
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,422
Didn't you hear?

257
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,157
For a sign?

258
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,625
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

259
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,528
Just get him
his sign back.

260
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,364
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

261
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,133
Why would
I keep his sign?

262
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,203
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

263
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,306
If you don't
return the sign,

264
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,807
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

265
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,976
Are we clear?

266
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,081
Listen,
I'm trying to help you.

267
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,383
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

268
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,884
The other guys,

269
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,719
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

270
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,788
because people
think you're weird.

271
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,724
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

272
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,509
Wait,
wait, wait.

273
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,776
Wait.

274
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,081
Thank you.

275
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,772
This building is so
awful, isn't it?

276
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,909
This building is so
awful, right, Mommy?

277
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,580
Yes, we can
hear you, GiGi.

278
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,549
It's so awful,
Mommy.

279
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,884
Right, Mommy?

280
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,127
- Good night.
- This building's

281
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,329
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

282
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,135
Hey.

283
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,909
Come on.

284
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,330
- Look up.
- Mmm.

285
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,466
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

286
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:10,303
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

287
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,803
What do you think
he's gonna do?

288
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,007
He's gonna help us.

289
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:18,478
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

290
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,313
Why would
he help us?

291
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,882
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

292
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,486
If he knew
how we were living,

293
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:31,357
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

294
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,360
I can't explain it to
you any better than that.

295
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,164
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

296
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,832
Or me.

297
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,168
Everybody's telling me

298
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:45,705
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

299
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:48,974
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

300
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,678
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

301
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,380
Don't you have to be
funny to be a comedian?

302
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,312
Hey, what's your name?

303
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,215
Arthur.

304
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:05,884
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

305
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,054
I know.

306
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,390
You know who's not?
Him.

307
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,896
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

308
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,465
Mom, what?

309
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,300
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

310
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,836
I'm watching
an old war movie!

311
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,438
Turn it down!

312
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,106
Um...

313
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,713
Sorry, Mom.

314
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:47,427
You good?

315
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:58,064
It's nice to see these
couples out at my show.

316
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,299
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

317
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:03,202
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

318
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,937
My favorite one
right now is

319
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,974
professor and senior
who really needs

320
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,308
to pass my class
to graduate.

321
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,044
Yes.

322
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,780
So, I'll tell you
how I operate.

323
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,082
I'm a professor at

324
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,583
a prestigious
New England university...

325
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,955
...and my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ."

326
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,726
I know. I know.

327
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:30,429
Why is she a senior in the intro?
I didn't buy it either.

328
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,565
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

329
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,301
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

330
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,537
She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis."

331
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,805
I can't use my real last
name at this college

332
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,307
'cause they
don't hire Jews.

333
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,377
It's something I'll address

334
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,646
once I have tenure,
but for now...

335
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,481
She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis,

336
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,882
I think I might be
in danger of failing

337
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,183
your 'Intro to Western Civ, '

338
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,418
and I just want
you to know

339
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,787
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

340
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:59,191
And I said,
"Anything?" And she said...

341
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,160
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

342
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,862
Were you following
me today?

343
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,301
Yeah.

344
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:19,472
I thought
that was you.

345
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:22,274
I was hoping you'd come
in and rob the place.

346
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:25,611
I have a gun.

347
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,580
I could come
by tomorrow.

348
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,518
You're so funny, Arthur.

349
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,023
Yeah.

350
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,557
You know,
I do stand-up comedy.

351
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,627
You should maybe come
see a show sometime.

352
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,729
I could do that.

353
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:44,797
Yeah?

354
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,932
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

355
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,200
Yeah.

356
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,527
Hoyt, please,
I love this job.

357
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,763
<i>Arthur, I need
to know why</i>

358
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,998
<i>you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.</i>

359
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,302
It's a prop.
It's part of my act now.

360
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,304
<i>That's bullshit.
Bullshit.</i>

361
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,141
<i>What kind of clown
carries a fucking gun?</i>

362
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,575
<i>Besides,
Randall told me</i>

363
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:05,845
<i>you tried to buy a .38
off him last week.</i>

364
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,246
Randall told you that?

365
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,249
<i>You're a fuck-up,
Arthur, and a liar.</i>

366
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:11,517
<i>You're fired!</i>

367
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,644
<i>Jefferson Street.</i>

368
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:40,513
<i>Next stop, Ninth Ave.</i>

369
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,617
I'm telling you,
she wanted my number.

370
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,452
We should've just stayed.

371
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,521
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.

372
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,224
Are you nuts?
Did you see how close we were dancing?

373
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,558
She was in love.

374
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,161
She couldn't wait to
get away from you.

375
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,662
Ryan! Ryan, am I crazy?
Tell him what you saw.

376
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,966
Hey,
you want some French fries?

377
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,437
Hello?

378
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,673
Talking to you.
Hey.

379
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,575
No, thank you.

380
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,746
You sure?

381
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,749
They're real good.

382
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:22,421
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.

383
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,523
Whoo...

384
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:50,916
Is something funny,
asshole?

385
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:56,589
Bitch!

386
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,448
So, buddy, tell us,
what's so fucking funny?

387
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,417
Nothing.

388
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:03,989
I have...
I have a condition.

389
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,226
I'll tell you what you
have, you asshole.

390
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,593
Whoa!

391
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,032
Please, stop!

392
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,167
We got
a kicker, huh?

393
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,468
Hey, hold him steady.
Hold him steady.

394
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:20,606
Stay down, freak!

395
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,926
Hey!

396
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,483
<i>Ninth Avenue.</i>

397
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,851
<i>Next stop,
Hunter's Point.</i>

398
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,187
Hey!

399
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,095
<i>Stand clear of
the closing doors.</i>

400
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,733
Shit. Shit.

401
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:50,109
I read it was
a guy in full makeup.

402
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,612
No,
it says right here it was a mask.

403
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:55,048
Either way,
I think it's good for business.

404
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:57,650
They got clowns on the
front of every newspaper.

405
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,152
Big man,
what's the good word?

406
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,353
Hey.

407
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:05,558
Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.

408
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,925
Sorry, mate.

409
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,661
Yeah.

410
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,995
It doesn't seem fair,

411
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,165
getting fired like that.

412
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:14,434
Did you really
bring a gun

413
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,802
to the children's
hospital, Artie?

414
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,304
What the fuck would
you do that for?

415
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:19,871
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

416
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,074
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

417
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,408
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

418
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,278
Why don't you ask
Randall about it?

419
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:27,480
It was his gun.

420
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:29,349
- What?
- I still owe you for that,

421
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,450
don't I?

422
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,751
What the fuck
are you talking about?

423
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,654
Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.

424
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,261
Oh, no!

425
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,830
I forgot
to punch out.

426
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:16,962
<i>And as our city
tries to make sense</i>

427
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,866
<i>of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week,</i>

428
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,402
<i>we're joined
by Thomas Wayne.</i>

429
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,936
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.

430
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:26,406
Yes, Mother.

431
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,906
<i>Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.</i>

432
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,108
They're asking him about

433
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:30,743
those horrible
subway murders.

434
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,111
<i>Thank you, Thomas.
I know</i>

435
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:34,147
<i>this is a difficult time
for you.</i>

436
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:35,814
Why him?

437
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,650
Looks like
he's gained weight.

438
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:40,186
<i>Yes,
all three worked for Wayne Investments.</i>

439
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:42,055
<i>Good, decent, educated.</i>

440
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:45,024
<i>Although I didn't know
any of them personally.</i>

441
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:47,926
<i>Like all Wayne employees,</i>

442
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,296
<i>past and present,
they're family.</i>

443
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:52,165
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

444
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:53,932
<i>There now seems to be</i>

445
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,934
<i>a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.</i>

446
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,237
<i>It's almost as if our
less fortunate residents</i>

447
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,540
<i>are taking the side
of the killer.</i>

448
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,408
<i>Yes,
and it's a shame.</i>

449
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:03,909
<i>It's one
of the reasons why</i>

450
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,345
<i>I'm considering
a run for mayor.</i>

451
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,281
<i>Gotham's lost its way.</i>

452
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:10,149
<i>What about
the eyewitness report</i>

453
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:12,851
<i>of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?</i>

454
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:15,021
<i>Well,
it makes total sense to me.</i>

455
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:17,523
<i>What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?</i>

456
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,026
<i>Someone who hides
behind a mask.</i>

457
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:21,461
<i>Someone who is envious</i>

458
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:25,565
<i>of those more fortunate
than themselves,</i>

459
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:28,534
<i>yet they're too scared
to show their own face.</i>

460
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:31,604
<i>And until those kind of
people change for the better,</i>

461
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:35,408
<i>those of us who have made
something of our lives</i>

462
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:38,010
<i>will always look
at those who haven't</i>

463
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:40,680
<i>as nothing but clowns.</i>

464
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:44,517
<i>Thomas Wayne,
thank you for coming in this morning.</i>

465
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:45,585
It's not funny.

466
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:09,575
I heard this song on
the radio the other day,

467
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:16,449
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

468
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,718
Arthur...

469
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:20,119
Which is crazy,

470
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:26,259
because that's
my clown name at work.

471
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:29,095
And until
a little while ago,

472
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:32,698
it was like
nobody ever saw me.

473
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:37,303
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

474
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,072
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

475
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:44,677
You don't listen,
do you?

476
00:40:46,212 --> 00:40:51,217
I don't think you
ever really hear me.

477
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,985
You just ask the same
questions every week.

478
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:58,458
"How's your job?
Are you having any negative thoughts?"

479
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:02,361
All I have are
negative thoughts,

480
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:05,364
but you don't
listen anyway.

481
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:09,001
I said,
for my whole life,

482
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:12,438
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

483
00:41:13,606 --> 00:41:15,374
But I do.

484
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:20,680
And people are
starting to notice.

485
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:24,150
They've cut our funding.

486
00:41:24,217 --> 00:41:26,152
We're closing down
our offices next week.

487
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,455
The city has cut funding
across the board.

488
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:31,557
Social Services is
part of that.

489
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:34,060
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

490
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,162
Okay.

491
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:42,335
They don't give a shit about
people like you, Arthur.

492
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:45,872
And they really
don't give a shit

493
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:48,107
about people
like me, either.

494
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,578
Fuck.

495
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:03,356
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

496
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:08,027
Who do I talk to?

497
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,231
I'm sorry, Arthur.

498
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:18,771
<i>I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.</i>

499
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:21,641
<i>You know, like,
"Can I see myself in this long-term?"</i>

500
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,776
<i>"Is it safe?"</i>

501
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:25,278
<i>"Is it reliable?"</i>

502
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,547
<i>"Could it kill me?"</i>

503
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:29,715
<i>Most guys,
we look at sex like parking a car.</i>

504
00:42:29,782 --> 00:42:32,351
<i>We're like,
"There's a spot."</i>

505
00:42:32,418 --> 00:42:33,753
<i>"There's another spot.</i>

506
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:35,321
<i>That would work."</i>

507
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:37,590
<i>"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."</i>

508
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,928
<i>"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."</i>

509
00:42:44,297 --> 00:42:46,866
<i>All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.</i>

510
00:42:51,804 --> 00:42:55,308
One more time
for Sam Morril, y'all.

511
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:57,209
All right, now,
this next comic describes

512
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:59,445
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident

513
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:02,015
who from a young age
was always told

514
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:03,816
that his purpose in life

515
00:43:03,883 --> 00:43:07,653
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.

516
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,388
Um... Okay.

517
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:11,724
Please help me welcome Arthur
Fleck, y'all.

518
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:12,858
Arthur Fleck.

519
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:39,719
Hello, it's good to be here.

520
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:07,313
I hated school
when I was a kid.

521
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:27,767
I hated school as a kid.

522
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,603
My mother
would say,

523
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,338
"You should enjoy it.

524
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:34,573
One day,
you'll have to work for a living."

525
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:37,144
"No, I won't, Ma,

526
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:38,978
I'm gonna
be a comedian."

527
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:49,488
Um...

528
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:53,826
Here's one.

529
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:56,829
You know,
I was just thinking the other day,

530
00:44:56,896 --> 00:44:59,265
why are the rich people...

531
00:45:39,472 --> 00:45:40,940
You believe that shit?

532
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:43,809
Fuck 'em.

533
00:45:45,644 --> 00:45:48,547
I think the guy that
did it is a hero.

534
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:52,651
Three less pricks
in Gotham City,

535
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:54,987
only a million
more to go.

536
00:46:26,552 --> 00:46:28,054
<i>And,
buddy, as always,</i>

537
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:29,355
<i>thanks for the laughs.</i>

538
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:30,823
<i>I'm sure
we'll see you again.</i>

539
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,259
<i>You know
we'll be here, right?</i>

540
00:46:32,324 --> 00:46:34,060
<i>I hope.</i>

541
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:37,429
<i>Tomorrow night, we have Diana
Hudson, Greg Gordon,</i>

542
00:46:37,496 --> 00:46:41,001
<i>and animal expert,
Hugh Little.</i>

543
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,368
<i>Thanks for watching.</i>

544
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:44,737
<i>Good night,
and always remember,</i>

545
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:46,338
<i>that's life.</i>

546
00:46:50,576 --> 00:46:51,911
That's life.

547
00:46:56,582 --> 00:47:00,086
Momma,
time to wake up and go to bed.

548
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:01,453
Hmm? Oh...

549
00:47:03,455 --> 00:47:05,025
Oh, Happy.

550
00:47:07,693 --> 00:47:09,495
Happy, I wrote
a new letter.

551
00:47:09,562 --> 00:47:12,065
Come on,
dance with me.

552
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:14,834
For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

553
00:47:23,576 --> 00:47:25,411
You smell like cologne.

554
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:28,114
It's 'cause I just
had a big date.

555
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:30,016
Oh.

556
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:34,587
Just don't forget
to mail it.

557
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:01,780
<i>The Murray
Franklin Show is taped live</i>

558
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:03,415
<i>before a studio audience</i>

559
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:05,784
<i>in beautiful downtown
Gotham City.</i>

560
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,616
You're gonna kill me.
You're gonna give me a heart attack!

561
00:49:10,683 --> 00:49:11,917
Don't give me your...

562
00:49:11,984 --> 00:49:13,886
No. No.

563
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:17,190
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!

564
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:18,457
Okay.

565
00:49:18,524 --> 00:49:19,792
Okay.

566
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,532
I'm not angry, Mom.

567
00:49:26,598 --> 00:49:29,135
I'm not angry.

568
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:30,569
Please.

569
00:49:31,404 --> 00:49:34,207
Mom, is this real?

570
00:49:37,743 --> 00:49:40,980
He's an extraordinary
man, Happy.

571
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:43,716
He's a very
powerful man.

572
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:47,753
We were in love.

573
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,755
He said it was best
that we not be together

574
00:49:49,822 --> 00:49:52,125
because of appearances.

575
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:57,997
And I could never
tell anyone because...

576
00:50:00,433 --> 00:50:02,002
Well, I signed
some papers.

577
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:05,171
And besides,
you can imagine

578
00:50:05,238 --> 00:50:08,941
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

579
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,013
What they'd say
about you.

580
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:19,152
What would
they say, Mom?

581
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:09,262
Hmm.

582
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,241
Hmm.

583
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:53,373
Hi.

584
00:52:56,342 --> 00:52:57,843
What's your name?

585
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:00,746
I'm Bruce.

586
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:02,948
Bruce.

587
00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:06,119
I'm Arthur.

588
00:53:27,906 --> 00:53:29,409
That's better.

589
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:32,011
Bruce! Bruce!

590
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:34,614
Get away
from that man.

591
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:36,848
It's okay.
I'm a good guy.

592
00:53:36,915 --> 00:53:38,750
What are you doing?
Who are you?

593
00:53:38,817 --> 00:53:40,420
I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne.

594
00:53:40,486 --> 00:53:43,289
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

595
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:45,824
Why did you give him
these flowers?

596
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:47,260
No,
they're not real.

597
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,197
It's magic.

598
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:52,864
I was just trying to
make him smile.

599
00:53:52,931 --> 00:53:55,734
Well, it's not funny,
is it?

600
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:57,036
Do I need
to call the police?

601
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:59,805
No. Please.

602
00:53:59,871 --> 00:54:03,109
My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.

603
00:54:03,176 --> 00:54:04,611
She used to work here years ago.

604
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:06,845
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

605
00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:09,415
You are her son.

606
00:54:09,482 --> 00:54:10,949
Yeah.

607
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:12,985
Did you know her?

608
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:19,359
I know
about the two of them.

609
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:21,960
She told me everything.

610
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:25,498
There's
nothing to know.

611
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:29,135
There is no "them."

612
00:54:29,202 --> 00:54:32,205
Your mother
was delusional.

613
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:33,606
She was
a sick woman.

614
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:35,907
Don't say that.

615
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:38,411
Just go.

616
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:39,811
Mmm?

617
00:54:39,878 --> 00:54:41,980
Before you make a
fool of yourself.

618
00:54:43,316 --> 00:54:46,252
Thomas Wayne
is my father.

619
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,558
He left me.

620
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,396
Let go! Let go!

621
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:24,424
Keep the respirations
above 15.

622
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:27,026
Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

623
00:55:28,227 --> 00:55:29,395
Mom?

624
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:31,164
What happened?

625
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,931
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

626
00:55:32,998 --> 00:55:34,500
- What happened?
- You can probably help us

627
00:55:34,567 --> 00:55:36,302
out inside.
We don't know what happened yet.

628
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:38,004
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- Step.

629
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:39,472
One more.
We got one more lift.

630
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:40,673
I'm getting

631
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,973
a little resistance here,
Michael.

632
00:55:44,577 --> 00:55:45,578
Lift.

633
00:55:51,017 --> 00:55:52,719
I'm right here.

634
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:54,087
Excuse me, sir.

635
00:55:54,153 --> 00:55:55,188
Does your mother take
any medications?

636
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:56,322
- No.
- Excuse me,

637
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:58,057
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

638
00:55:58,124 --> 00:55:59,359
Sir, when was the last
time you spoke to her?

639
00:55:59,425 --> 00:56:00,560
I don't know.

640
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:47,707
Mr. Fleck.

641
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:49,941
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

642
00:56:50,009 --> 00:56:52,512
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

643
00:56:52,578 --> 00:56:55,515
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

644
00:56:56,915 --> 00:56:58,518
so we spoke
with your mother.

645
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,320
Oh.

646
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:03,856
What did you
say to her?

647
00:57:03,922 --> 00:57:04,990
Did you do this?

648
00:57:05,057 --> 00:57:06,559
What? No.

649
00:57:06,626 --> 00:57:08,828
No, no, no.
We just asked her some questions,

650
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:10,563
and she got hysterical.

651
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,298
Hyperventilating,

652
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:13,733
collapsed and hit
her head pretty hard.

653
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,335
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

654
00:57:16,402 --> 00:57:18,905
We're sorry to
hear about that.

655
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:22,108
But, like I said,
I still have some questions for you.

656
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,376
They're about
the subway killings

657
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:24,911
that happened
last week.

658
00:57:24,976 --> 00:57:26,312
You've heard about them, right?

659
00:57:26,379 --> 00:57:27,513
Yeah.

660
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,648
It's horrible.

661
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:30,583
Right.

662
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:34,020
So, we spoke with your
boss over at Haha's.

663
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,122
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

664
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:37,956
into the children's hospital.

665
00:57:39,192 --> 00:57:41,227
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

666
00:57:41,294 --> 00:57:43,196
It's part
of my act.

667
00:57:43,262 --> 00:57:44,597
I'm a party clown.

668
00:57:44,664 --> 00:57:46,998
All right.
So, why were you fired?

669
00:57:50,036 --> 00:57:52,738
They said
I wasn't funny enough.

670
00:57:52,805 --> 00:57:54,640
Can you imagine that?

671
00:57:54,707 --> 00:57:58,644
If you don't mind,
I have to go take care of my mother.

672
00:57:58,711 --> 00:58:01,314
Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

673
00:58:03,282 --> 00:58:05,751
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

674
00:58:06,552 --> 00:58:07,887
is it real,

675
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:10,189
or some sort
of clown thing?

676
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:13,125
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

677
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:15,628
I mean, is it part of your act?

678
00:58:18,097 --> 00:58:19,565
What do you think?

679
00:58:25,304 --> 00:58:26,572
It's exit only.

680
00:58:50,963 --> 00:58:53,165
She's gonna be okay.

681
00:58:57,336 --> 00:58:59,305
I'm gonna
get a coffee.

682
00:58:59,872 --> 00:59:00,940
You want one?

683
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:02,208
Yeah.

684
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:18,157
<i>So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,</i>

685
00:59:18,224 --> 00:59:21,394
<i>you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.</i>

686
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,062
<i>I told him,
"The garbage strike</i>

687
00:59:23,129 --> 00:59:24,830
<i>is still going on, Billy."</i>

688
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:26,732
<i>And he says, and I'm not
kidding, Billy says,</i>

689
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,935
<i>"So, where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?"</i>

690
00:59:35,942 --> 00:59:38,511
<i>And finally,
in a world where everyone</i>

691
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:40,246
<i>thinks they could
do my job,</i>

692
00:59:40,313 --> 00:59:42,348
<i>we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,</i>

693
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:44,150
<i>right here in Gotham.</i>

694
00:59:44,216 --> 00:59:45,651
<i>Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,</i>

695
00:59:45,718 --> 00:59:48,187
<i>it'll somehow
make you funny.</i>

696
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:50,289
<i>Check out
this joker.</i>

697
00:59:54,827 --> 00:59:56,295
Oh, my God.

698
00:59:56,362 --> 01:00:00,199
<i>I
hated school as a kid.</i>

699
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:03,369
<i>But my mother
would always say,</i>

700
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:05,038
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

701
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:08,041
<i>One day,
you'll have to work for a living."</i>

702
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:09,442
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

703
01:00:09,508 --> 01:00:11,277
<i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>

704
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,619
<i>You shoulda
listened to your mother.</i>

705
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:23,756
<i>Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.</i>

706
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:26,959
<i>All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.</i>

707
01:00:27,027 --> 01:00:28,661
<i>It's funny,</i>

708
01:00:28,728 --> 01:00:30,896
<i>when I was
a little boy</i>

709
01:00:30,963 --> 01:00:34,101
<i>and told people I was
gonna be a comedian,</i>

710
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:36,268
<i>everyone laughed at me.</i>

711
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:39,372
<i>Well, no one's
laughing now.</i>

712
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:44,744
<i>You can say
that again, pal.</i>

713
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:53,053
<i>All right,
we got a great show for you tonight.</i>

714
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,522
<i>Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,</i>

715
01:00:56,589 --> 01:01:00,660
<i>and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.</i>

716
01:01:06,232 --> 01:01:08,934
<i>As tensions
mount around the metro area,</i>

717
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:12,738
<i>Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.</i>

718
01:01:12,805 --> 01:01:14,540
<i>City services
have been affected,</i>

719
01:01:14,607 --> 01:01:16,609
<i>and some businesses
have decided</i>

720
01:01:16,676 --> 01:01:19,578
<i>to remain closed
amid the unrest.</i>

721
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:22,381
<i>Chuck Stevens
filed this report.</i>

722
01:01:22,448 --> 01:01:23,916
<i>The anger and resentment</i>

723
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:25,184
<i>that's been building
in the city for weeks</i>

724
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:27,087
<i>seems close to exploding.</i>

725
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:29,388
<i>Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,</i>

726
01:01:29,455 --> 01:01:31,024
<i>took to the streets today</i>

727
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:32,558
<i>in one of several
planned demonstrations</i>

728
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:34,326
<i>taking on
the city's elite,</i>

729
01:01:34,393 --> 01:01:35,995
<i>including a massive rally
outside</i>

730
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:38,664
<i>tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.</i>

731
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:40,399
<i>What's
the point of all this?</i>

732
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:42,334
<i>- the rich.</i>
<i>- Thomas Wayne.</i>

733
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:44,104
<i>That's what this whole</i>
<i>thing is about.</i>

734
01:01:44,171 --> 01:01:45,938
<i>the whole system.</i>

735
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,273
<i>Wayne,
who recently announced</i>

736
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:48,607
<i>he is running for mayor,</i>

737
01:01:48,674 --> 01:01:50,476
<i>will be attending
the benefit.</i>

738
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:52,611
<i>You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne</i>

739
01:01:52,678 --> 01:01:54,081
<i>who first referred to</i>

740
01:01:54,147 --> 01:01:56,949
<i>many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."</i>

741
01:01:57,017 --> 01:02:00,286
<i>Today, he offered little
in the way of an apology.</i>

742
01:02:00,352 --> 01:02:01,754
<i>Well, what
I will say is,</i>

743
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:03,190
<i>there's something wrong
with those people.</i>

744
01:02:03,255 --> 01:02:04,623
<i>I am here
to help them.</i>

745
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:05,958
<i>I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,</i>

746
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:07,393
<i>help make
their lives better.</i>

747
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,295
<i>That is why
I'm running.</i>

748
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:11,263
<i>And they may not realize
it, but I'm their only hope.</i>

749
01:02:26,879 --> 01:02:29,749
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

750
01:02:29,815 --> 01:02:32,718
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

751
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:14,480
Can I help you, pal?

752
01:05:16,482 --> 01:05:18,385
I don't know
what to say.

753
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,157
Do you want an
autograph or something?

754
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:25,424
No.

755
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:32,965
My name is Arthur.

756
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:36,136
Penny Fleck
is my mother.

757
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:39,239
Jesus.

758
01:05:39,306 --> 01:05:41,207
You're the guy that came
to my house yesterday.

759
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,476
Yes.

760
01:05:44,543 --> 01:05:46,512
I'm sorry
I just showed up.

761
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:48,148
But my mother
told me everything,

762
01:05:48,214 --> 01:05:49,815
and I had
to talk to you.

763
01:05:49,882 --> 01:05:52,451
Look, pal,
I'm not your father.

764
01:05:52,518 --> 01:05:54,087
What's wrong with you?

765
01:05:55,621 --> 01:05:57,456
Look at us.

766
01:05:58,657 --> 01:06:00,126
I think you are.

767
01:06:00,193 --> 01:06:01,760
Well, that's impossible

768
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:03,029
because you're adopted,

769
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:04,797
and I never slept with
your mother.

770
01:06:04,863 --> 01:06:05,931
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

771
01:06:05,998 --> 01:06:07,499
- Money?
- No, I don't...

772
01:06:07,566 --> 01:06:08,734
I wasn't adopted.

773
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:10,903
Jesus.
She never told you?

774
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,538
Told me what?

775
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:15,908
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

776
01:06:15,975 --> 01:06:17,509
That's not true.

777
01:06:17,576 --> 01:06:18,811
Why are you
saying that?

778
01:06:18,877 --> 01:06:19,745
Then she was arrested
and committed

779
01:06:19,812 --> 01:06:20,980
to Arkham State Hospital,

780
01:06:21,047 --> 01:06:22,614
when you were
just a little boy.

781
01:06:22,681 --> 01:06:23,882
Why are you
saying this?

782
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:25,584
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

783
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:26,952
I know
it seems strange.

784
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,754
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

785
01:06:28,821 --> 01:06:30,556
I don't know why
everyone is so rude.

786
01:06:30,622 --> 01:06:31,857
I don't know
why you are.

787
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:33,393
I don't want
anything from you.

788
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,894
Maybe a little bit of
warmth, maybe a hug, Dad!

789
01:06:35,961 --> 01:06:38,231
How about just a little
bit of fucking decency?

790
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:39,665
What is it
with you people?

791
01:06:39,732 --> 01:06:41,967
You say that stuff
about my mother.

792
01:06:42,035 --> 01:06:43,336
She's crazy.

793
01:06:43,403 --> 01:06:45,671
She's...

794
01:06:52,945 --> 01:06:54,646
You think
this is funny?

795
01:06:55,948 --> 01:06:59,285
Dad, it's me.
Come on.

796
01:07:01,954 --> 01:07:03,189
Touch
my son again,

797
01:07:03,256 --> 01:07:04,757
I'll fucking kill you.

798
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:27,213
<i>Hello, Mr. Fleck.

799
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,615
<i>We met the other night
at Gotham General.</i>

800
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:32,185
<i>My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.</i>

801
01:07:32,252 --> 01:07:35,255
<i>We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.</i>

802
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:37,390
<i>Please give me a call
when you get this message.</i>

803
01:07:37,457 --> 01:07:39,459
<i>Again, Detective Garrity,</i>

804
01:07:39,526 --> 01:07:43,729
<i>and my number
is 212... 99.</i>

805
01:08:26,372 --> 01:08:28,508
<i>This message is
for Arthur Fleck.</i>

806
01:08:28,575 --> 01:08:30,143
<i>My name
is Shirley Woods.</i>

807
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,611
<i>I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.</i>

808
01:08:32,678 --> 01:08:34,080
<i>I don't know
if you're aware,</i>

809
01:08:34,147 --> 01:08:35,448
<i>but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up</i>

810
01:08:35,515 --> 01:08:37,417
<i>on the show recently,</i>

811
01:08:37,484 --> 01:08:39,785
<i>and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.</i>

812
01:08:39,852 --> 01:08:42,621
<i>Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...</i>

813
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:48,094
Who is this?

814
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:49,928
<i>Oh, hi,
this is Shirley Woods.</i>

815
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:53,099
<i>I'm the show booker from</i>
Live with Murray Franklin.

816
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:54,200
<i>Is this Arthur?</i>

817
01:08:56,202 --> 01:08:57,470
Yes.

818
01:08:57,537 --> 01:08:59,339
<i>Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,</i>

819
01:08:59,405 --> 01:09:01,441
<i>we've gotten a lot of
calls about your clip.</i>

820
01:09:01,508 --> 01:09:03,176
<i>Amazing responses.</i>

821
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:05,445
<i>And Murray asked if I
would reach out to you</i>

822
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:07,413
<i>to see if you would
come on as his guest.</i>

823
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:15,821
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

824
01:09:15,888 --> 01:09:17,656
<i>Yeah.
Isn't that great?</i>

825
01:09:17,723 --> 01:09:21,528
<i>He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?</i>

826
01:09:21,594 --> 01:09:23,929
<i>That sound good
to you?</i>

827
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:30,103
Yeah, that sounds great.

828
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,038
<i>Can we set up a date right now?</i>

829
01:09:32,105 --> 01:09:34,073
<i>Are you available
next Thursday?</i>

830
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:28,261
Hey.

831
01:10:28,328 --> 01:10:31,364
Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

832
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:33,600
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

833
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:37,070
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

834
01:10:38,171 --> 01:10:40,406
Can I ask you
a question?

835
01:10:40,473 --> 01:10:42,041
Sure.

836
01:10:42,108 --> 01:10:47,046
How does someone
wind up in here?

837
01:10:47,113 --> 01:10:51,351
Have they all,
all the people committed crimes?

838
01:10:51,417 --> 01:10:53,019
Well, yeah, some have.

839
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:56,055
You know,
some are just crazy.

840
01:10:56,122 --> 01:10:58,757
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

841
01:10:58,824 --> 01:11:00,293
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

842
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,495
Don't know what to do, you know?

843
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:06,299
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

844
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:10,603
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

845
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:14,707
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

846
01:11:14,773 --> 01:11:18,877
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

847
01:11:19,945 --> 01:11:21,147
What's that?

848
01:11:22,382 --> 01:11:25,884
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

849
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:31,424
You know
what I'm talking about,

850
01:11:31,491 --> 01:11:36,462
it's so hard to just try
and be happy all the time.

851
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:41,034
Hey, listen, man.

852
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,669
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

853
01:11:42,735 --> 01:11:44,203
Like a clerk,
you know.

854
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:46,139
All I do
is file paperwork.

855
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,874
I don't know
what to tell you.

856
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:50,842
But you should
see somebody.

857
01:11:50,909 --> 01:11:52,111
You know,
they got programs,

858
01:11:52,178 --> 01:11:54,880
city services,
stuff like that.

859
01:11:54,946 --> 01:11:56,316
Oh, yeah.

860
01:11:56,382 --> 01:11:58,084
They cut all those.

861
01:12:03,022 --> 01:12:05,091
All right, here it is. Fleck.

862
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:07,959
Penny Fleck.
Let's see.

863
01:12:08,027 --> 01:12:13,066
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

864
01:12:13,132 --> 01:12:17,236
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

865
01:12:17,303 --> 01:12:21,274
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

866
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,109
"Was found guilty
of endangering

867
01:12:23,176 --> 01:12:26,912
the welfare
of her own child."

868
01:12:34,953 --> 01:12:36,155
What?

869
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:41,060
You said
she's your mother.

870
01:12:45,832 --> 01:12:47,567
Uh...

871
01:12:47,633 --> 01:12:49,669
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

872
01:12:49,736 --> 01:12:52,839
you know,
without proper forms.

873
01:12:52,904 --> 01:12:55,208
I could
get in trouble.

874
01:12:55,274 --> 01:12:57,577
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

875
01:12:57,643 --> 01:12:59,278
that'll be much easier,

876
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:01,880
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

877
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:03,149
I'm sorry.

878
01:13:07,086 --> 01:13:09,856
No, man! Shit!

879
01:13:09,921 --> 01:13:12,024
Come on, man.
Give it...

880
01:13:12,759 --> 01:13:15,194
Hey! Hey!

881
01:14:12,951 --> 01:14:16,689
<i>We went over this, Penny.
You adopted him.</i>

882
01:14:16,756 --> 01:14:19,192
<i>We have all the
paperwork right here.</i>

883
01:14:19,258 --> 01:14:21,561
<i>That's not true.</i>

884
01:14:21,627 --> 01:14:24,030
Thomas had that
all made up,

885
01:14:24,096 --> 01:14:27,066
so it stayed
our secret.

886
01:14:28,534 --> 01:14:31,704
<i>You also
stood by</i>

887
01:14:31,771 --> 01:14:33,039
while one
of your boyfriends

888
01:14:33,105 --> 01:14:36,676
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

889
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:39,178
and battered you.

890
01:14:58,798 --> 01:15:00,666
Penny,

891
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:04,704
your son was found
tied to a radiator

892
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:07,173
in your filthy apartment.

893
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,909
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

894
01:15:09,976 --> 01:15:11,978
and severe trauma
to his head.

895
01:15:13,913 --> 01:15:16,549
I
never heard him cry.

896
01:15:16,616 --> 01:15:20,386
He's always been such
a happy little boy.

897
01:17:21,273 --> 01:17:22,808
It's time
for bed.

898
01:17:26,212 --> 01:17:27,913
Oh, my God!

899
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,182
What are you doing in here?

900
01:17:32,351 --> 01:17:34,453
You're in the
wrong apartment.

901
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,162
Your name's Arthur, right?

902
01:17:43,229 --> 01:17:44,597
You live
down the hall.

903
01:17:47,566 --> 01:17:49,602
I really
need you to leave.

904
01:17:53,639 --> 01:17:56,809
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

905
01:18:01,914 --> 01:18:03,182
Please.

906
01:18:05,718 --> 01:18:07,920
I had a bad day.

907
01:18:10,589 --> 01:18:13,392
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

908
01:19:39,411 --> 01:19:41,347
Shut up!

909
01:20:00,332 --> 01:20:01,867
Hey, Penny.

910
01:20:04,237 --> 01:20:05,704
Penny Fleck.

911
01:20:13,646 --> 01:20:15,714
I always hated
that name.

912
01:20:19,019 --> 01:20:21,353
You know how you used to tell me

913
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,891
that my laugh
was a condition?

914
01:20:27,127 --> 01:20:29,595
That there was
something wrong with me?

915
01:20:32,464 --> 01:20:33,833
There isn't.

916
01:20:36,535 --> 01:20:38,604
That's the real me.

917
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:40,472
Happy.

918
01:20:42,441 --> 01:20:45,011
Happy. Hmm.

919
01:20:48,281 --> 01:20:50,916
I haven't been happy

920
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:53,586
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

921
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:01,894
You know
what's funny?

922
01:21:04,496 --> 01:21:06,532
You know what really
makes me laugh?

923
01:21:08,634 --> 01:21:11,370
I used to think that my
life was a tragedy...

924
01:21:12,972 --> 01:21:15,041
...but now I realize

925
01:21:15,108 --> 01:21:16,775
it's a fucking comedy.

926
01:22:27,213 --> 01:22:28,681
<i>A very fine actor.</i>

927
01:22:28,747 --> 01:22:31,550
<i>He's got a new movie</i>
<i>called</i> American Playboy

928
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:33,386
<i>opening this week
across the country.</i>

929
01:22:33,452 --> 01:22:35,521
<i>Will you please
welcome a good friend</i>

930
01:22:35,587 --> 01:22:37,656
<i>of the show,
Mr. Ethan Chase.</i>

931
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:59,179
<i>Good to see you, Ethan.
You're looking great, Ethan.</i>

932
01:22:59,245 --> 01:23:01,014
<i>Thank you very much.
You're looking good yourself.</i>

933
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:02,715
<i>Ah,
can't complain.</i>

934
01:23:02,781 --> 01:23:05,118
Hey, Murray.
Thanks so much for having...

935
01:23:06,386 --> 01:23:07,820
Hey, Murray.

936
01:23:07,886 --> 01:23:09,955
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

937
01:23:10,023 --> 01:23:12,524
It's been a lifelong
dream of mine.

938
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,861
<i>I'm nervous
right now.</i>

939
01:23:17,364 --> 01:23:19,698
- <i>You are?</i>
<i>- I am nervous.</i>

940
01:23:19,765 --> 01:23:21,967
Hey, Murray.
I've been on...

941
01:23:34,747 --> 01:23:36,515
I'm sorry.
What's that?

942
01:23:37,616 --> 01:23:39,651
Oh, that's
very funny, Murray.

943
01:23:40,686 --> 01:23:42,888
You know,
I'm also a comedian.

944
01:23:42,955 --> 01:23:44,391
Would you like
to hear a joke?

945
01:23:45,557 --> 01:23:48,261
Yeah?
All of you?

946
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:49,528
Okay.

947
01:23:52,365 --> 01:23:53,433
Knock...

948
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,800
Knock, knock.

949
01:24:08,515 --> 01:24:09,948
Knock, knock.

950
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:08,301
Coming.

951
01:26:19,379 --> 01:26:20,779
Hey, Arthur.

952
01:26:20,846 --> 01:26:22,048
How's it going?

953
01:26:22,848 --> 01:26:24,651
Oh, hey, guys.

954
01:26:24,716 --> 01:26:26,319
Come on in.

955
01:26:26,386 --> 01:26:27,686
Did you get
a new gig?

956
01:26:28,254 --> 01:26:29,721
No.

957
01:26:29,788 --> 01:26:33,092
Oh, you must be going down
to that rally at City Hall.

958
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:34,960
I hear
it's gonna be nuts.

959
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:36,895
Oh, is that today?

960
01:26:37,463 --> 01:26:39,132
Yeah.

961
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,933
What's with
the makeup then?

962
01:26:42,302 --> 01:26:43,769
My mom died.

963
01:26:43,835 --> 01:26:45,205
I'm celebrating.

964
01:26:45,938 --> 01:26:47,006
Right. We heard.

965
01:26:47,073 --> 01:26:48,675
That's why
we came by.

966
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:51,578
We figured, you know,
you could use some cheering up.

967
01:26:51,644 --> 01:26:53,413
Aw, that's sweet.

968
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:56,949
But, no, I feel good.

969
01:26:57,016 --> 01:26:58,784
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

970
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,752
I feel
a lot better now.

971
01:27:02,655 --> 01:27:05,258
Oh, okay.
Good for you.

972
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:10,129
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

973
01:27:10,196 --> 01:27:13,266
but the cops have been
coming around the shop,

974
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:17,303
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

975
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:19,405
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

976
01:27:21,174 --> 01:27:24,277
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

977
01:27:24,344 --> 01:27:27,146
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

978
01:27:32,784 --> 01:27:34,053
Anyway, um,

979
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:38,191
Hoyt said that
they talked to you,

980
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:39,692
and now
they're looking for me,

981
01:27:39,758 --> 01:27:41,294
and I just wanna know
what you said.

982
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:43,162
Make sure
our stories line up.

983
01:27:43,229 --> 01:27:46,132
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

984
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:48,001
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

985
01:27:48,067 --> 01:27:50,203
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

986
01:27:55,642 --> 01:27:57,110
Arthur!

987
01:27:57,176 --> 01:27:58,844
No!

988
01:27:59,911 --> 01:28:01,114
What?

989
01:28:02,382 --> 01:28:03,383
No!

990
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:13,259
Why would
you do that, Arthur?

991
01:28:34,247 --> 01:28:36,582
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

992
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:38,184
Yeah.

993
01:28:39,252 --> 01:28:41,421
I'm gonna be
on tonight.

994
01:28:45,325 --> 01:28:47,327
It fucking crazy, innit?

995
01:28:47,393 --> 01:28:49,262
Me on the telly.

996
01:28:51,097 --> 01:28:53,266
What the fuck, Arthur?

997
01:28:54,467 --> 01:28:55,535
What?

998
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,008
It's okay, Gary.

999
01:29:02,075 --> 01:29:03,409
You can go.

1000
01:29:05,745 --> 01:29:07,447
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

1001
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:11,917
Oh!

1002
01:29:11,983 --> 01:29:14,253
Don't look.
Just go.

1003
01:29:26,699 --> 01:29:27,899
Fuck.

1004
01:29:32,938 --> 01:29:34,340
Hey, Arthur?

1005
01:29:34,407 --> 01:29:36,309
Yeah?

1006
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:39,112
Arthur,
can you get the lock?

1007
01:29:42,281 --> 01:29:43,583
Shit.

1008
01:29:43,649 --> 01:29:45,218
Sorry, Gary.

1009
01:29:56,028 --> 01:29:57,296
Gary?

1010
01:29:57,363 --> 01:29:58,364
Yeah.

1011
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,469
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

1012
01:30:05,538 --> 01:30:06,905
Skedaddle.

1013
01:31:33,893 --> 01:31:35,428
Hey, Arthur!

1014
01:31:35,495 --> 01:31:36,929
We need to talk.

1015
01:31:36,995 --> 01:31:38,097
Oh!

1016
01:31:38,164 --> 01:31:40,366
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

1017
01:31:45,705 --> 01:31:46,772
Arthur!

1018
01:31:49,242 --> 01:31:51,143
Watch it!
Out of the way!

1019
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,281
Move!

1020
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:58,284
Arthur!

1021
01:31:59,118 --> 01:32:00,520
Shit.

1022
01:32:02,822 --> 01:32:04,090
Hey! Hey!

1023
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,131
Arthur, stop!

1024
01:32:17,703 --> 01:32:18,704
Go! Go!

1025
01:32:20,406 --> 01:32:22,708
<i>Now
departing, O-Train, downtown.</i>

1026
01:32:24,477 --> 01:32:26,479
<i>Stand clear of
the closing doors.</i>

1027
01:32:35,821 --> 01:32:38,524
Hold that train!
Hold it!

1028
01:32:40,259 --> 01:32:42,461
Get out!
Get outta here!

1029
01:32:42,528 --> 01:32:44,363
<i>Next stop, Bedford Park.</i>

1030
01:32:58,744 --> 01:32:59,812
Masks off!

1031
01:32:59,879 --> 01:33:01,380
Get your mask off!

1032
01:33:02,049 --> 01:33:03,849
Signs down! Now!

1033
01:33:12,992 --> 01:33:14,560
Police! Signs down!

1034
01:33:15,695 --> 01:33:16,762
Signs down.

1035
01:33:21,334 --> 01:33:22,668
What the fuck!

1036
01:33:25,404 --> 01:33:26,772
Beat his ass!

1037
01:33:33,346 --> 01:33:35,048
Stop fighting! Police!

1038
01:33:35,114 --> 01:33:37,416
Police! Get down!

1039
01:33:39,352 --> 01:33:41,654
Get down!
Get the fuck back!

1040
01:33:42,722 --> 01:33:43,723
Police! Get down.

1041
01:33:44,457 --> 01:33:45,758
Get the fuck down!

1042
01:33:50,363 --> 01:33:52,865
Stay the fuck back!
Down!

1043
01:33:56,369 --> 01:33:57,570
What the...

1044
01:34:00,873 --> 01:34:01,874
Arthur!

1045
01:34:02,541 --> 01:34:03,509
Burke!

1046
01:34:05,078 --> 01:34:06,646
Don't do it!

1047

<i>Two officers on the train</i>

1048

1056
01:35:17,717 --> 01:35:18,751
Murray.

1057
01:35:18,818 --> 01:35:20,419
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1058
01:35:20,486 --> 01:35:22,988
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

1059
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,424
Thank you, Murray.

1060
01:35:26,392 --> 01:35:28,527
I feel like
I know you.

1061
01:35:28,594 --> 01:35:30,730
I've been
watching you forever.

1062
01:35:30,796 --> 01:35:31,964
Thank you.

1063
01:35:32,032 --> 01:35:33,399
What's with the face?

1064
01:35:33,466 --> 01:35:35,634
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

1065
01:35:35,701 --> 01:35:36,736
No.

1066
01:35:36,802 --> 01:35:39,139
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1067
01:35:39,206 --> 01:35:41,108
I don't believe
in anything.

1068
01:35:41,174 --> 01:35:43,076
I just thought it'd
be good for my act.

1069
01:35:43,143 --> 01:35:44,744
For your act?
Didn't you hear

1070
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:46,345
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

1071
01:35:46,412 --> 01:35:47,913
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1072
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:49,482
No, I hadn't heard.

1073
01:35:49,548 --> 01:35:50,816
- Yeah.
- You see? This is

1074
01:35:50,883 --> 01:35:52,351
what I'm telling you.
The audience is

1075
01:35:52,418 --> 01:35:53,586
gonna go crazy
if you put this guy on.

1076
01:35:53,652 --> 01:35:55,488
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1077
01:35:55,554 --> 01:35:58,290
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1078
01:35:58,357 --> 01:36:00,960
We're gonna go with it.

1079
01:36:01,027 --> 01:36:02,428
Thank you, Murray.

1080
01:36:02,495 --> 01:36:03,729
Couple rules, though.

1081
01:36:03,796 --> 01:36:05,798
No cursing.
No off-color material.

1082
01:36:05,865 --> 01:36:07,299
We do a clean show.

1083
01:36:07,366 --> 01:36:08,567
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1084
01:36:08,634 --> 01:36:10,237
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1085
01:36:10,302 --> 01:36:11,370
I love Dr. Sally.

1086
01:36:11,437 --> 01:36:12,805
Good, good.
Someone will

1087
01:36:12,872 --> 01:36:15,175
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

1088
01:36:15,242 --> 01:36:16,342
Good luck.

1089
01:36:16,408 --> 01:36:17,610
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

1090
01:36:18,577 --> 01:36:22,015
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

1091
01:36:22,082 --> 01:36:23,682
When you
bring me out,

1092
01:36:23,749 --> 01:36:25,718
can you
introduce me as Joker?

1093
01:36:25,785 --> 01:36:27,987
What's wrong
with your real name?

1094
01:36:28,054 --> 01:36:30,723
That's what you
called me on the show.

1095
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:31,957
A joker.

1096
01:36:32,025 --> 01:36:33,260
Do you remember?

1097
01:36:33,325 --> 01:36:35,195
- Did I?
- I don't know.

1098
01:36:35,262 --> 01:36:37,797
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.

1099
01:36:37,863 --> 01:36:38,931
It's good.

1100
01:36:38,998 --> 01:36:40,066
Thanks, Murray.

1101
01:37:01,921 --> 01:37:03,522
I'll try it,
you know,

1102
01:37:03,589 --> 01:37:05,292
but I'm not sure my
wife will let me do it.

1103
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:08,061
Maybe my next wife.

1104
01:37:11,697 --> 01:37:13,566
You gotta see our next
guest for yourself.

1105
01:37:13,632 --> 01:37:15,868
I'm pretty sure this
guy could use a doctor.

1106
01:37:15,935 --> 01:37:17,170
Oh!

1107
01:37:17,237 --> 01:37:18,838
Does he have
sexual problems?

1108
01:37:18,904 --> 01:37:21,174
Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

1109
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:25,178
All right, Bobby,
let's show that clip one last time.

1110
01:37:31,184 --> 01:37:34,486
<i>I hated
school as a kid.</i>

1111
01:37:35,921 --> 01:37:39,025
<i>But my mother
would always say,</i>

1112
01:37:39,092 --> 01:37:40,893
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

1113
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,762
<i>One day,
you'll have to work for a living."</i>

1114
01:37:43,829 --> 01:37:44,964
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

1115
01:37:45,031 --> 01:37:47,167
<i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>

1116
01:37:53,206 --> 01:37:56,942
Okay. You may...

1117
01:37:57,010 --> 01:38:00,280
You may have seen that
clip of our next guest.

1118
01:38:00,347 --> 01:38:03,116
Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say

1119
01:38:03,183 --> 01:38:04,583
that we're
all heartbroken

1120
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:06,685
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1121
01:38:06,752 --> 01:38:09,055
But this is how he
wanted to come out,

1122
01:38:09,122 --> 01:38:12,558
and honestly,
I think we could all use a good laugh.

1123
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:15,861
So, please welcome, Joker.

1124
01:38:57,469 --> 01:38:58,971
Are you
all right, Doctor?

1125
01:39:02,641 --> 01:39:05,211
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

1126
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:12,851
You okay?

1127
01:39:15,521 --> 01:39:16,922
Yeah.

1128
01:39:16,989 --> 01:39:19,959
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1129
01:39:21,727 --> 01:39:23,595
Well, that makes
one of us.

1130
01:39:30,469 --> 01:39:32,671
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1131
01:39:32,738 --> 01:39:34,374
When we spoke earlier,

1132
01:39:34,441 --> 01:39:36,309
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1133
01:39:36,376 --> 01:39:37,609
Is that right?

1134
01:39:37,676 --> 01:39:39,112
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1135
01:39:39,179 --> 01:39:41,880
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1136
01:39:41,947 --> 01:39:44,150
And how's that going for you?

1137
01:39:52,025 --> 01:39:53,959
So, I know
you're a comedian.

1138
01:39:54,027 --> 01:39:55,894
You been working on
any new material?

1139
01:39:55,961 --> 01:39:57,263
You wanna
tell us a joke?

1140
01:40:03,036 --> 01:40:04,037
Yeah?

1141
01:40:06,172 --> 01:40:07,173
Okay.

1142
01:40:13,213 --> 01:40:14,913
He's got a book.

1143
01:40:15,647 --> 01:40:17,217
A book of jokes.

1144
01:40:26,892 --> 01:40:28,660
Take your time.
We got all night.

1145
01:40:34,434 --> 01:40:36,869
Okay, okay.
Here's one.

1146
01:40:39,772 --> 01:40:42,442
Knock, knock.

1147
01:40:42,509 --> 01:40:43,976
And you had to
look that up?

1148
01:40:50,883 --> 01:40:52,785
I want to
get it right.

1149
01:40:54,454 --> 01:40:56,156
Knock, knock.

1150
01:40:56,222 --> 01:40:57,823
Who's there?

1151
01:40:58,991 --> 01:41:00,592
It's the police, ma'am.

1152
01:41:00,659 --> 01:41:02,594
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1153
01:41:02,661 --> 01:41:05,564
He's dead.

1154
01:41:06,932 --> 01:41:08,667
Oh, no, no, no.

1155
01:41:08,734 --> 01:41:10,602
No, you cannot
joke about that.

1156
01:41:10,669 --> 01:41:12,505
Yeah, that's
not funny, Arthur.

1157
01:41:12,571 --> 01:41:15,741
That's not that kind of
humor we do on this show.

1158
01:41:15,808 --> 01:41:18,111
Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1159
01:41:18,178 --> 01:41:22,681
It's just, you know,
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.

1160
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:26,219
Ever since

1161
01:41:28,455 --> 01:41:31,024
I killed those three
Wall Street guys.

1162
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:39,598
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.

1163
01:41:40,799 --> 01:41:42,768
There is
no punch line.

1164
01:41:43,902 --> 01:41:46,005
It's not a joke.

1165
01:41:50,543 --> 01:41:51,677
You're serious,
aren't you?

1166
01:41:51,743 --> 01:41:52,978
You're telling us
you killed

1167
01:41:53,046 --> 01:41:54,180
those three young men
on the subway?

1168
01:41:54,247 --> 01:41:55,181
Mmm-hmm.

1169
01:41:55,248 --> 01:41:57,016
And why should
we believe you?

1170
01:41:57,083 --> 01:41:59,252
I got nothing
left to lose.

1171
01:42:01,054 --> 01:42:03,289
Nothing can
hurt me anymore.

1172
01:42:06,226 --> 01:42:09,728
My life is
nothing but a comedy.

1173
01:42:12,831 --> 01:42:14,167
Well, let me
get this straight,

1174
01:42:14,234 --> 01:42:16,336
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1175
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:18,338
I do.

1176
01:42:18,404 --> 01:42:21,174
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

1177
01:42:21,241 --> 01:42:23,642
Comedy is subjective,
Murray.

1178
01:42:23,709 --> 01:42:25,545
Isn't that
what they say?

1179
01:42:25,612 --> 01:42:27,480
All of you,

1180
01:42:27,547 --> 01:42:30,083
the system
that knows so much,

1181
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,985
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1182
01:42:33,052 --> 01:42:38,424
The same way that you
decide what's funny or not!

1183
01:42:39,691 --> 01:42:41,227
Get him off!

1184
01:42:41,294 --> 01:42:45,265
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

1185
01:42:45,331 --> 01:42:46,899
that you did this to
start a movement,

1186
01:42:46,965 --> 01:42:49,602
to become a symbol?

1187
01:42:49,668 --> 01:42:51,171
Come on, Murray.

1188
01:42:51,237 --> 01:42:52,572
Do I look like
the kind of clown

1189
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,174
that could
start a movement?

1190
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:57,177
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1191
01:42:57,243 --> 01:42:59,912
Everybody is awful
these days.

1192
01:42:59,978 --> 01:43:02,282
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1193
01:43:02,348 --> 01:43:04,217
Okay.
So, that's it, you're crazy.

1194
01:43:04,284 --> 01:43:06,919
That's your defense for
killing three young men?

1195
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,954
No.

1196
01:43:09,022 --> 01:43:12,691
They couldn't carry a
tune to save their lives.

1197
01:43:14,227 --> 01:43:18,331
Oh, why is everybody so
upset about these guys?

1198
01:43:18,398 --> 01:43:20,166
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1199
01:43:20,233 --> 01:43:21,800
you'd walk
right over me!

1200
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:24,037
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1201
01:43:24,103 --> 01:43:26,306
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1202
01:43:26,372 --> 01:43:28,074
went and cried about them on TV?

1203
01:43:28,141 --> 01:43:30,443
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1204
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:32,312
Yes, I do.

1205
01:43:32,378 --> 01:43:35,981
Have you seen what it's
like out there, Murray?

1206
01:43:36,049 --> 01:43:39,152
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1207
01:43:39,219 --> 01:43:43,356
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

1208
01:43:43,423 --> 01:43:45,425
Nobody's civil anymore.

1209
01:43:45,491 --> 01:43:49,928
Nobody thinks what it's
like to be the other guy.

1210
01:43:49,995 --> 01:43:52,831
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1211
01:43:52,898 --> 01:43:54,933
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1212
01:43:55,001 --> 01:43:57,869
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1213
01:43:57,936 --> 01:44:00,039
They think that
we'll just sit there

1214
01:44:00,106 --> 01:44:02,774
and take it,
like good little boys!

1215
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:05,178
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1216
01:44:05,245 --> 01:44:06,613
You finished?

1217
01:44:06,679 --> 01:44:09,215
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1218
01:44:09,282 --> 01:44:10,916
You sound like
you're making excuses

1219
01:44:10,983 --> 01:44:12,385
for killing
those young men.

1220
01:44:12,452 --> 01:44:14,520
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1221
01:44:14,587 --> 01:44:16,122
not everyone is awful.

1222
01:44:18,157 --> 01:44:19,592
You're awful, Murray.

1223
01:44:19,659 --> 01:44:21,628
Me? I'm awful?

1224
01:44:21,694 --> 01:44:23,496
Oh, yeah,
how am I awful?

1225
01:44:25,632 --> 01:44:27,200
Playing my video.

1226
01:44:28,334 --> 01:44:31,237
Inviting me
on this show.

1227
01:44:31,304 --> 01:44:34,707
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1228
01:44:34,773 --> 01:44:36,609
You're just like
the rest of them.

1229
01:44:36,676 --> 01:44:38,678
You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.

1230
01:44:38,745 --> 01:44:41,681
Look what happened,
because of what you did. What it led to.

1231
01:44:41,748 --> 01:44:43,383
There are riots
out there.

1232
01:44:43,449 --> 01:44:45,018
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

1233
01:44:45,084 --> 01:44:46,452
and you're laughing.

1234
01:44:46,519 --> 01:44:47,986
You're laughing.

1235
01:44:48,054 --> 01:44:50,590
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1236
01:44:50,657 --> 01:44:52,225
I know.

1237
01:44:54,494 --> 01:44:56,062
How about another joke, Murray?

1238
01:44:56,129 --> 01:44:57,764
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

1239
01:44:57,863 --> 01:44:59,065
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

1240
01:44:59,132 --> 01:45:01,833
...when you cross
a mentally-ill loner

1241
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:04,237
with a society
that abandons him

1242
01:45:04,304 --> 01:45:05,605
and treats him
like trash?

1243
01:45:05,672 --> 01:45:07,140
Call the police, Gene!

1244
01:45:07,206 --> 01:45:08,374
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

1245
01:45:08,441 --> 01:45:10,109
You get what you
fucking deserve!

01:49:28,701 --> 01:49:30,169
Go over there.

1275
01:49:47,887 --> 01:49:49,689
Hey, Wayne.

1276
01:49:49,755 --> 01:49:51,824
You get what you
fucking deserve.

1277
01:49:51,891 --> 01:49:53,259
No! Pal!

1278
01:50:33,633 --> 01:50:35,901
Come on,
get up!

1279
01:50:35,968 --> 01:50:37,970
Come on,
man, get up.

1280
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:19,398
What's so funny?

1281
01:53:23,203 --> 01:53:24,870
Just thinking
of a joke.

1282
01:53:43,823 --> 01:53:46,026
Do you want
to tell it to me?

1283
01:53:52,165 --> 01:53:53,966
You wouldn't get it.
